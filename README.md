# Revenge Plugin Requests

Welcome to the Revenge Plugin Requests repository, where users can submit plugin requests for Revenge.

## How to submit a plugin request

Before submitting a plugin request, please make sure to check it hasn't already been suggested. You can search for it in the [issues tab](https://github.com/Revenge-mod/plugin-requests). If it has been suggested, simply react with a 👍 emoji. Please avoid leaving comments such as "I like this" or "bump!", as it may spam contributors' inboxes.

If the plugin has not been suggested yet, feel free to submit your request [here](https://github.com/Revenge-mod/plugin-requests/issues/new/choose).

## How to claim a plugin request

If you come across a plugin request that interests you and it is available, reply to the issue to let us know that you are interested in
working on it.

### I have completed my plugin

Once you have finished developing your plugin, simply reply to the issue with the link to your plugin. It's as simple as that!
